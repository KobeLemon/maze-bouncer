# Overview

This is **Maze Bouncer**! This is a game made in the Godot Game Engine with its native GDScript language. In this game, the player controls a character that uses gravity & velocity to constantly bounce. The player utilizes this bouncing to explore a maze, trying to find the exit & picking up collectibles along the way.

I am developing this game because it is something that sounded really fun to me and I wanted to make it a reality. I just started game development and I want to make something that people of any skill level can play and enjoy!
